# Java Core & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This repository is a **focused collection of Java programs**, starting from **Java basics** and progressing step-by-step to **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

The purpose of this repository is to build a **strong and practical foundation in Java**, with emphasis on **clean syntax, logical thinking, and real-world OOP design**, rather than just theoretical understanding.

## 📌 Topics Covered

The programs in this repository cover:

- Java program structure and execution
- Variables, data types, and input/output
- Control flow statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays and string manipulation
- Methods and method overloading
- Classes and objects
- Constructors and `this` keyword
- Encapsulation (private members, getters & setters)
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction using abstract classes
- Interfaces and multiple inheritance (Java way)
- OOP-based mini projects and real-world examples

Each concept is reinforced through **daily hands-on coding challenges**, with an average of **10–15 programs per day**.

## 📂 Code Organization

Programs are organized **day-wise**, following a structured learning path from basics to advanced OOP concepts.  
Each directory represents one day of learning and contains programs related to the topics practiced on that day.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Build strong fundamentals in Java
- Develop an object-oriented mindset
- Write clean, modular, and readable code
- Prepare a solid base for:
  - Data Structures & Algorithms
  - Backend development
  - AIML and software projects
  - Technical interviews

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Java (JDK)
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA ( I use Both)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📈 Practice Discipline

- Consistent daily coding
- Concept-focused programs
- No copy–paste without understanding
- Emphasis on clarity over shortcuts

---

## 🧠 Note

This repository represents **intentional learning**, not random practice.  
Each program is written to strengthen core Java and OOP understanding.
